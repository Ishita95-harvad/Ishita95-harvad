 ⚡ Fun fact: Bananas are technically berries, but strawberries are not!
Botanically speaking, a berry is a fruit that develops from a single ovary and has seeds inside. Since bananas fit that definition, they’re considered berries. Meanwhile, strawberries develop from a flower with multiple ovaries, which disqualifies them from being true berries. Nature is full of surprises! 🍌
